# Portafolio

Formal single-page portfolio for **Alistair Pablo Coll Corona** built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The page includes responsive layouts, dark/light theming, JSON-LD metadata, and a validated contact form.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` directly in your browser to preview locally. To adjust copy or styling, edit the inline `<style>` or content blocks in the same file.

### Assets

Place the downloadable CV at `assets/Alistair_Coll_CV.pdf`. The Open Graph image reference expects `assets/share-image.jpg`; replace it with the real file name once you have your share graphic.

## Deployment

Because the site is static, you can host it anywhere that serves plain files:

- **GitHub Pages** – push this repo to GitHub and enable Pages from the repository settings (root directory). Pages will publish automatically.
- **Netlify** – drag and drop the project folder into the Netlify dashboard or connect the repo. No build command is necessary.
- **Vercel** – import the repository, choose the “Other” framework preset, and set the output directory to `.`.

After deploying, test the hosted URL in both light and dark themes, and confirm the contact links open your default mail and phone handlers.
